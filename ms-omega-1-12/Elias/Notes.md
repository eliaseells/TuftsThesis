# Weird Marks:
- Odd squared off mark in red ink to the left of urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001.e4:1.296
- Odd tau over squiggle and double dots left of urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001.e4:2.102 
- Beta at the start of urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001.e4:2.494 is an especially ornate capital for the middle of a book. It begins the Catalogue of Ships.
- There is a red zeta, eta, superscript tau, and circle with a slash through it to the left of urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001.e4:4.333, these indicate that the following lines, 334-336, are out of sequence. The lines in question appear at the bottom of the main page. The circle with a slash could be a marker for moving or omission and the red zeta, eta, superscript tau could suggest a reading of Zenodotus. Need to keep an eye out for similar occurences.
- Line 5.300 has a blue mark next to it giving the line number. I'm not sure whose hand it is because I haven't seen that ink color before and it is only three characters. so hard to distinguish from the other scripts. urn:cite2:hmt:e4.v1:43v

# Image Issues:
- The image for urn:cite2:hmt:e4.v1:30v is upside down.
- urn:cite2:hmt:e4.v1:59v has two images.
- urn:cite2:hmt:e4.v1:66r and urn:cite2:hmt:e4.v1:66v appear to be missing. The image labelled as urn:cite2:hmt:e4.v1:67r begins Bk. 8, but urn:cite2:hmt:e4.v1:65v is commentary, so it's possible that two pages of commentary are missing or the labeling has gotten off-kilter. On further examination, this appears to be an off-by-one error. But, there is a mark in the upper right hand corner of the page labelled urn:cite2:hmt:e4.v1:67r that could be a number 67. Where are 66 recto and verso?
- There are three images of urn:cite2:hmt:e4.v1:90v. (1/22/18)
- There are three images of urn:cite2:hmt:e4.v1:103v.	urn:cite2:hmt:e4img.2017a:e4_139 is an unusable image. (1/22/18)
- There are three images of urn:cite2:hmt:e4.v1:120v. (1/29/18)
- There seems to be a folio missing from the image inventory. Between 122v and 123r, there is a jump from 14.77 to 14.156. (1/31/18)
- There seems to be a folio missing from the image inventory. The full page images jump from line 544 to line 629, but in the margins of image for 143v, I can clearly read ἀεικίσσωσι, which is in urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001.e4:16.545. (3/8/18)
- There is a third missing image in book 22. The images jump from urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001.e4:22.232 to urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001.e4:22.311 from 190v to 191r. The missing lines can be read in the image margins of 190v. (3/13/18)

# Questions/Notes:
- Is an outdent more important than rubrication? At urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001.e4:2.48 on urn:cite2:hmt:e4.v1:15v, there is an outdent, but the η is black. This is a spot where Willcock has a paragraph break. For now (1/1/18), I have considered it part of a larger paragraph because every other place I would consider the outdent a paragraph it is red.
- I encountered a similar occurence at urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001.e4:2.484 on urn:cite2:hmt:e4.v1:21r:, but have    declined call it a paragraph break due to the lack of rubrication. It is marked in my list: Outdents without Rubrication. (1/10/18)
- There is a whole page of commentary (urn:cite2:hmt:e4.v1:21v) before the beginning of the Catalogue of Ships on urn:cite2:hmt:e4.v1:22r
- There could be a paragraph break at urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001.e4:2.759 on urn:cite2:hmt:e4.v1:25r as that line ends the Catalogue of Ships, but while urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001.e4:2.760 begins an outdent there is no rubrication and the combination of outdenting and rubrication has been my rule for determining paragraph separation. (1/10/18)
-Some, but not all of the outdents without rubrication occur at places where Willock has paragraph separation. It might be helpful later on to develop a model where these are treated as subsets in a paragraph or some sort of view that examines the relationship between the rubricated and non-rubricated outdents. (1/10/18)
- urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001.e4:3.276 on line urn:cite2:hmt:e4.v1.30v the hand is similar to the paragraph hand, a large and thicker letter, but it lacks rubrication, so for now it will go in the Outdents without Rubrication list. It begins a speech. (1/10/18)
